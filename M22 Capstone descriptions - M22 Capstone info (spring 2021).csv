Every intervention in the passage of time reflects what the culture currently values. Deliberate destruction, careful preservation and sanitization, or an allowance of the natural processes of decay, are all choices on what to keep from the relentless beating of time and what to submit to it. The allowance of decay of the heartland's farms is tied to the growing strain of the romanticized midwestern country ideal.

The project will apply concepts from continental theorists and authors on ruins and decay, typically centered on European artifacts, to a new context of contemporary abandoned barns in rural Illinois.

QUESTION: Why is there low insurance uptake & coverage in African countries (With a keen focus on Kenya), and how it be increased?

On average, only 2 out of 10 Kenyans have any insurance cover (e.g., health insurance). Therefore, I shall analyze the reasons why people are reluctant to pay for insurance and look for potential solutions that would encourage people to buy insurance. I would like to create public awareness of insurance and make insurance premiums easily accessible and available to everyone. I shall conduct thorough research on the insurance laws in Kenya, insurance companies & brokers, internal processes & systems, risks, macroeconomic & microeconomic issues, insurance premiums charged & how to pay them, the benefits, how to file claims, exclusions, how to identify a suitable insurance plan & cover. 
I shall also compare different insurance plans, domestically and internationally, including quantitative information - this involves analyzing financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statements), financial ratios, and marketing strategies that can be adopted by stakeholders.
I will do an all-round analysis of insurance in Kenya to have substantial knowledge to identify the advantages & disadvantages of strategies, and make recommendations.

FINAL DELIVERABLE: A Policy proposal, that is customized and suitable for Kenyans. I shall also provide additional resources such as useful apps, business plans and websites to support my analysis & provide insurance information.

As consumers become more aware of the underlying environmental and ethical issues of certain products/services, companies started being more vocal about sustainability. However, many of those attempts are a mere act of pretending to appear ""sustainable"" to take advantage of the market trend. It is important to distinguish genuine acts towards sustainability from greenwashing but it can be tricky to do so. The idea aims to explain the concept of greenwashing, reasons why some companies engage in greenwashing, and ways to distinguish it from ""real"" sustainable practices. Thus, I plan to create a criteria/framework that makes this distinction easier to spot. Consumers can use this framework to avoid greenwashing and make educated choices. I also want to further explore effective strategies companies can use to communicate their sustainability practices without appearing like they are greenwashing when they are not. 

Guiding Questions: 
How might we distinguish greenwashing from green marketing?
How might we help businesses effectively communicate their sustainability practices? 

Approach: 
- Literature review on greenwashing, exploring research studies on market trends, cognitive biases (psychology in general), and ethics
- Creating a framework based on the literature review

Guiding Question: What's the relationship between journalists and activists, specifically around human rights issues, in the contemporary digital information landscape?

Main Idea: Reconsidering the mutually influential dynamics of journalism and activism based on their functioning within and across contemporary human rights social movements. The working thesis of the project is that current notions of journalism and activism do not consider numerous aspects of the interrelated nature of both in the 21st-century technological and political landscape. Failing to critically (re)consider the relationship of journalism and activism —independently and interdependently—  ignores the functioning of both national and international society today.

Purpose: This project deepens the conceptual foundations of and critically considers current shifting dynamics and practices in the field of journalism as it pertains to social movements.

Methodology: A case study comparative analysis approach drawing on complexity and systems thinking to consider a small selection of contemporary non-US human rights social movements. This draws heavily upon SS112 and SS156. Tentatively, I plan to employ a post-positivist complexity paradigm (embracing elements of qualitative and quantitative research to balance subjectivity and objectivity) through systematic analysis of the interactions between agents in understanding the dynamics of interactions of journalism and activism in the complex adaptive system of social movements. Currently, the selection of case studies includes the anti-CAA movement in India, the #ENDSARS movement in Nigeria, and the Freedom for Uighurs movement in China.

Deliverable: Currently, I plan to produce an externally-publishable series of multimodal long-form essays in the style of The Atlantic, The New Yorker, or Aeon. However, I am open to considering alternative styles of deliverable so long as the externally-publishable focus remains and the essential outcome is high-quality research and analysis in succinct, high-caliber prose.

Keywords: Journalism, Activism, Human Rights, Digital, Social Movements",Highly committed,"Creative (e.g., writing, art), Secondary research (e.g., literature review with analysis/synthesis and proposal for future work), Journalism","Field: Journalism

Main Idea: Produce a high-quality journalism portfolio with a focus on public service journalism and sustained focus on themes related to social justice.

Purpose: Develop, practice, and refine key journalism skills to complete the project with a professionally attractive portfolio.

Guiding Question: Currently, I have not settled on a theme for the portfolio pieces and, consequently, do not have a driving question. The focus area remains topics of government involvement around the social sector (e.g., racial justice, gender justice, labor justice, etc).

Deliverables: 4 to 6 pieces of journalism between 1,000 to 1,500 words each (deep dives on topics around a central theme); introduction to the style of journalism employed; explanation of the methodology and best practices used throughout

Methodology: Public service journalism alongside a more topic-specific form of journalism. Currently favoring legal journalism to investigate court cases around topics of race, gender, or labor. 

This project involves the external dependency of interviews. Sketched generally, for every piece of journalism I aim to produce, I ought to plan 4 to 6 interviews. Consequently, in aiming to produce 4 to 6 journalism pieces, I am considering conducting anywhere from 16 to 36 interviews. While this is doable within the current one-year time frame, I run the risk of people not responding, not being available on timelines conducive to Capstone’s academic timeline, or not being insightful (even if they’re available & responsive).

Highly committed as an independent project, moderately committed as a Capstone idea","all potential dependencies have been secured (e.g., datasets, IP agreements), At this point, the project could be completed with no external dependencies, however, depending on the specifics of case study research, I may find external resources needed. I plan to select case studies which avoid such challenges.",Have not submitted a description yet,"Content knowledge of case studies -> Currently, I have already conducted extensive research on India's Anti-CAA movement previously for academic purposes (SS112). Additionally, I have conducted moderate personal research on #ENDARS in Nigeria, but I still need to further research on this movement and on the Freedom for Uighurs movement in China. In conducting this research, I will rely on extensive news article coverage as well as whatever scholarly works exist (although this may be limited due to the recency of some of these movements).

Skill of Essaying -> Writing in this particular medium (similar to The Atlantic & The New Yorker) is a skill I'm developing on my own rather than from formal training. I  have moderate practice from Round 2, but I would benefit from further refining my skill through medium-specific research and (ideally, but unlikely since I am yet to find them) additional online courses.

Skill of Graphic design -> For successfully implementing the planned visual components of the essay (part of the planned multimodal design), I will need to continue developing graphic design skills. Over the last year, I've passively learned this skill for creating Quest cover art but may need to seek external help or tailor the visual components to my skill level."

- My intended approach is to construct linear regression models with monthly returns data on Barclay Hedge Fund Index from 2017 to 2021 and six factors (value, size, momentum, low volatility, quality, and growth) to replicate long-short hedge funds portfolios. The portfolio weights would be determined by regressing individual long-short hedge-fund returns on the factors. Based on the analysis, I would decompose the funds’ expected returns into manager-specific alpha and risk premia. These results would suggest appropriate factors that could return reasonably compelling investment performance. If a long-short hedge fund generates the expected return and risk profile from certain factors, then, by taking on those risk exposures, there is a possibility to construct a low-cost, high transparency passive portfolio, instead of an actively managed portfolio (a dynamic approach), that captures the fund’s risk and reward characteristics. Next, I would summarize the statistics of our identified factors for long-short hedge fund portfolios, including mean, standard deviation, confidence intervals, R-square, and p-value, and evaluate their explanatory powers for the funds.

I will be going over a range of quantum algorithms that will be useful when working with image data, such as algorithms for storing the data, classifying the data, etc.. Alongside the review paper I will be implementing and comparing the algorithms on the toy example below:

The minimum viable product is to build a robust shape detection algorithm for photos shot through a webcam, that can identify sets in the game SET (I have a less robust version currently working, but it requires some decently finicky calibration to the light conditions). 
Then to make the image detection a bit more robust, I was thinking about training a neural network on it, though this would mean I would have to take a bunch of photos in various lighting conditions, etc. From there, we build our way up. Firstly, the current way to identify sets is simply to brute force is, as we're mostly talking 12 choose 3 combinations, sometimes 15 choose 3. 

Now, for the quantum algorithms:
I will be implementing the GQIR algorithm from Wang 2017 which encodes image data into qubits more efficiently than classically possible.

I have yet to find algorithms for pre-processing the data (e.g. gamma correction, color masking, etc.) and for stuff like contour detection.

When the data has been somewhat processed, we then wish to classify it, which could be done using QSVM or a quantum nearest centroid classifier as implemented in Johri 2020.
Finally to pick out the right solutions, I will use Grover's search algorithm, a quantum algorithm which does unordered searches in O(sqrt(n)). While it's obviously a poor use for such a small space to search, I believe I can condense this search down to only using 28 qubits which means I will be able to run it on IBM's state of the art classical simulators, since we simply don't have the hardware to actually run the algorithm for useful problems yet.

As such, in a perfect world, I will have a working product running classically in real time, and a proposed model on how this problem could be efficiently solved given access to a fault-tolerant quantum computer.

The atmospheric turbulence due to different layers and temperature, known as scintillation, affects the precision of the data, which requires more sophisticated methods and the possibility to send telescopes outside of Earth, which both can be quite expensive to develop.
Astronomers then use an equation known as Young's approximation to calculate the noise caused by the atmosphere. Recent studies show it underestimates scintillation, which also was able to correct for better precision (Fischer et al., 2012). I want to explore more of this corrected equation and explore ways to automate the process and reduce the noise. Hence, I narrowed down my question to: How can we use neural networks to reduce scintillation noise for photometric measurements?
Recently, there are many studies involving using neural networks to correct images on Earth that are interrupted by scintillation caused by temperature in the area. I want to use a similar approach but applying for telescopes.
Then, my plan currently is to provide two deliveries. For the research paper:
It will be a research paper with a standard model: Introduction, hypothesis/analysis, methodology, testing, test analysis, conclusion/discussion. I intend to explore the corrected equation (and possibility) a better one and use it to reduce the noise from scintillation using neural networks to remove or highly decrease the signal-noise from the readings. I intend to explore the model and optimize the model and provide a whole research background about it.
Moreover, I would like to provide a python library. Besides the research paper to illustrate the experiment, I would like to make a python library to be used by astronomers or any other professional in the field to be able to use it to automate the process and reach a better precision in their calibrations.

Specific Idea: Black holes are notorious for being very difficult to study directly/observe. But, we can create physical systems in laboratories which are mathematically analogous to gravitational black holes. Many people have tried to explore whether these physical systems can teach us anything about their gravitational counterparts. This is a relatively new field and lacks any good literature review which can act as a place for condensation of knowledge. My goal is to write a review on the analogue methods used to study Black Holes.
I think the major component of the project will be trying to explain the mathematical equations and analogies to non-specialized audiences while still being rigorous and staying true to the equations.
A stretch goal is to do some theoretical research in summer about the limitations of physical systems in studying specific black hole phenomena.

Deliverables: A literature review paper which can be published in a journal (includes discussion of theory and published literature) + a discussion on whether analogies are useful in this case and what more can they tell us
Stretch Goal for summer: Theoretical research on limitations of analogue systems (dependent on the summer research opportunity)

Purpose: The purpose is to create a sort of hub for all the information regarding analogue black holes explained by assuming the most minimal knowledge. This will serve as a sort of introduction to anyone who wants to pursue the direction of analogue gravity. Therefore, it must explain the equations and analogies in general and in specific systems, and give a breakdown and summary of the research and results that have already been done. 
The personal purpose for doing this is to learn more about black holes and the theory behind it.

Approach/Methodology: My current approach is to search for papers in the common databases (Google Scholar, WorldCat) and select papers which seem related to analogue black holes. I intend to go through about 100 papers and select papers from them which I intend to review thoroughly. I will be using a selection criteria which involves relevance, citation count, and importance of result.
For the theoretical part of the review, I will be relying heavily on General Relativity courses, other online courses, and papers which explain certain components of analogies.

Elaboration on the “organized form”: Visualize a giant spreadsheet (in reality, it will be saved on our databases) where each rows represent each distinct userIDs (Class101 currently has around 2 million registered users, so there will be 2 million rows), and each columns are any characteristics or behavioral data about the user (i.e. age, gender, how many Class101 Ads they clicked on, how many online classes they clicked on, etc). There can be hundreds of columns.

The main objective of the project is to discover features (which will be the columns from the “user data table”) that has the greatest contribution towards CLTV. We would also like to investigate the scale of the contribution — how much exactly does it have an effect on the CLTV. I will be the project manager of a group of 5-ish Data Engineers/Analysts/Scientists who will be working on this with me during the Summer.

- The SaaS solution will provide an application programming interface (API) that leverages the JSON data-interchange format.

Studies have shown that the Philippines is still a country where consumers and business still depend on physical cash for transactions and does not consider other forms of payments. However, there are already multiple apps and software that easily allows consumers and stores that don't really have a good financial background to acquire digital wallets.

Approach and deliverables: I already have something that is working for this capstone, but so far since all the computations are running on the client side the AI can only look 2 levels deep on the tree of possible movements, which ends up making it not very hard to beat it (current best AI algorithms for chess looks at more than 50 level deeps). The approach would be to change the way the code is written so we can have part of it running on the server side on a cloud backend. So this would involve changing the algorithm from client side to server side, and to build the engine on the server that would handle all computations. The best approach to this is to make computations parallel in as much servers as possible, so we can look deeper, and then merge the results of all of them. For this approach I would be developing it similarly to the web application one (incrementally, building small features over time). So besides using the LOs listed above I would also have space for CS152 LOs, such as: #aicoding and #search.

How can we help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Rwanda to conduct rigorous and effective financial forecasts, that help improve access to funding opportunities?

SMEs make 90% of Rwanda’s private sector ecosystem that is central to the land-locked country’s development. However, current research indicates that most of them fail due to a lack of funding. My hypothesis is that these businesses do not have rigorous financial forecasts, which may undermine their growth and profit potential, hence limit funding accessibility. I discussed this idea with the Director of Stanford Seed and he agreed that these businesses do struggle with forecasting their financial growth. 

For my capstone project, I am thinking of creating a consulting firm that does market research which helps project how demand might grow. Our consulting services would include financial forecasting and strategic recommendations on helping an emerging company achieve its growth potential. 

Academic relevance: Business major, Finance & Operations
Three concepts mostly inspired this idea; institutional voids from B112, disruptive innovation in B146, and value-creating growth in B155. 

Institutional voids: My working hypothesis is that this narrows down to a lack of current data that is common in emerging economies. Further analysis will most likely reveal new, and probably different insights. But whatever it will narrow down to, my project will likely center around addressing the identified institutional void. 

Disruptive innovation: Consulting services are usually for larger enterprises with vast financial resources. My working custom LO is #disrupt, whereby, I will identify and propose a service tailored for the bottom of the pyramid/ lower-tier market. This will likely reveal concepts/ frameworks such as Jobs to be done and the 5P’s whereby one of them will be affordable price/ cost. 

Value-creating growth and capital allocation: The core of this project is to help SMEs access funding by reflecting their growth potential through financial forecasts. I hope to use B155 learnings to identify ways to forecast growth for growing businesses considering a very changing trajectory. The strategic recommendations will likely include steps to maintain/ achieve sustainable growth as well.",Highly committed,"Primary research (e.g., with a research group), Secondary research (e.g., literature review with analysis/synthesis and proposal for future work), Interview/survey, Data analysis, Policy analysis/proposal, Business plan","- A critical analysis of scaling Dalberg Data Insight's services to other African countries.

Specific idea: Climate change is nonlinear, often feels psychologically distant for many individuals, and is a public goods dilemma, making it challenging to take action on. Research has shown that communicating climate change as a human health problem rather than an environmental problem is effective in addressing the obstacles individuals have when thinking, discussing, and acting on climate change. Through focusing on health, one of the top human values, people feel more affected by climate change, which overcomes some psychological and cognitive obstacles.

Question: “How might we analyze and convey the human health impact of particulate matter (PM2.5) to engage cautious Minnesotans on the topic of climate change?”

Intended deliverables: 
I have three main deliverables:
1. A literature review on science communication and why framing climate change as a human health problem rather than as an  environmental problem is strategic and necessary for cautious and disengaged Minnesotans specifically.
2. Scientific report on the human health impact of PM2.5 in Minnesota. This report will be created specifically for an audience of cautious Minnesotans.

I will use pre-existing research available through the Claremont Database to identify the impact the level of PM2.5 has on human health.

ABSTRACT:
The aim of this capstone project is to develop an educational course for the new generations of stock market investors with a goal of democratization of stock market education. In the US and in many other countries, generally people are advised to seek/hire financial advisors to manage their wealth for the longer term which are invested in different pension funds, stocks, ETFs, etc. Recently, with the rise and easy access to commission-free brokerage firms and trading applications like- Robinhood, Webull, EToro, TradeZero and many more, there is a rise in investing/day-trading activities among many young people who view the stock market as a passive means of earning money by trading on risky but highly profitable options and other derivatives products in the stock market. These young people do not invest for the long run but rather for a short period of time to gain a good sum of profits. They often consider trading like a ‘game’ and engage in trading these risky market instruments without any knowledge of the financial market or any relevant skills. Last year, a 20-Year-Old Robinhood customer died by suicide after seeing a $730,000 negative balance on his Robinhood trading account (Gara, 2020). He was allowed to over leverage his investment and engaged in risky options trade without any prior education. Because of the rising popularity of day trading and options trading, there are many educators who sell courses online to teach trading. However, these courses cost a lot of money, usually above $1000 but often these online ‘gurus’ turn out to be fake/scam. It is high time, retail-investors become cautious about the consequences of trading high risk market instruments without sufficient knowledge. I believe in the democratization of stock market education because I think achieving financial literacy and financial freedom should be one of the life goals of every person for a prosperous and thriving economy and there should be opportunities in place to achieve these knowledge so that the country can produce a financially literate generation. The stock market is one of the means to increase one’s financial assets and achieve financial independence and hence, anybody who wants to invest or trade by themselves should do proper due diligence by learning about the ins and outs of the stock market. With this belief in heart, I want to design and develop an educational curriculum  on Stock market trading named “The Wolf of MainStreet: The Complete Course on Foundation Stock Trading” which will be made available for helping people to learn about the stock market before trading.

INTENDED DELIVERABLES 

For my capstone, my primary deliverable will be a complete course curriculum on Foundational stock market trading. My target audience will be adults over 18 who are interested about trading with a small amount of capital. They want to trade options or stocks for profits which can become a smooth passive income over time by consistently becoming profitable. I will develop the course contents, create videos and lectures. Then I would like to partner with the Financial Analyst Club at Minerva and provide these materials for free to the interested students. The students will have 2 months to learn the topics and then I will organize a Trading competition on the paper money version in ThinkorSwim stock trading platform among the participants. The  top 3 students with the highest returns receive prize money. 

JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT 

According to Data analyzed by Cerulli Associates, Day-trading has become very popular worldwide during the pandemic and has dramatically increased in 2020 compared to prior years (Annie Nova,2020). This concludes the rising popularity of short term investing or day trading. The article on CNBC also argued for some of the reasons for this increase. People are trying to recover the lost money from unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing number of ads portraying day-trading as a ‘get rich quick’ way. This advertisement and its popularity is bringing new inexperienced people to trade in the stock market for quick gains. Another article by CNBC discusses the time value of starting investing early for teenagers, which fosters a sense of responsibility among the teenagers that can have a great impact on them. For instance, $100 invested in the S&P 500 would be worth $110 after 1st year and $133 after 3 years if the index gains 10% a year (Booth,2020). Thus, it is necessary to create platforms for learning and remove the barriers to achieving these educations, and it is what I want to achieve through the capstone project.

Current title: Sensory marketing as a solution to consumers’ unwillingness to try new products when shopping online.

Specific idea: Consumers no longer buy products alone. Instead, they search and buy experiences around purchased goods. Research shows that customers need the store atmosphere to examine and choose the products (visually pleasing stands, ability to touch the products, etc). However, much of that experience became limited due to Covid-19 restrictions, which prompted users to embrace delivered goods. This change consequently led to a more limiting customer experience. For example, consumers are less willing to try new products when shopping online, arguably because of the absence of atmospherics. Therefore, this project will assess how in-store atmospherics research can be used for delivered goods (e-commerce websites and unboxing) to improve customer experience and willingness to try new products. The findings will remain relevant after the pandemic as online shopping will become a more wide-spread habit than it was pre-pandemic.

Deliverable: A visually-pleasing paper, written in a digestible way.

1) Examine the current state of customer experience related to the delivered goods; 
2) Synthesize current research on atmospherics in offline stores, their combinations + their impact on customer experience; 
3) Determine how they can be applied to delivered goods; 
4) Discuss the implications of the findings for companies and customers (corporate social responsibility, ethics of sensory marketing).

A pivot to one/few atmospherics is possible in case the topic is too broad. For example, visuals as the most impactful atmospheric or olfactory (I have explored this one so far and found it interesting since there are many marketing agencies specializing in it).",Still looking for other project ideas,"Secondary research (e.g., literature review with analysis/synthesis and proposal for future work)","General topic: Marketing Mindsets

Specific idea: How to market unrelatable goods? During a hackathon for an FMCG company, my team and I found it particularly challenging to suggest ideas about the product because we could not relate to it. My research suggests that there are resources on biases, empathy, and understanding others, however, none of them are specific to the field of marketing. My initial idea was to create a framework of how troubles like these can be mitigated based on the book Mindwise and the Five-step systematic approach to information problem-solving framework.

Method/approach: The main issue was that I felt unmotivated by how theoretical the project was. Therefore if I were to continue working on the idea, I would like it to include a case study or something practical. 


Possibly involves interacting with people and/or their data (needs Minerva HSR committee approval): as a practical part I may end up doing interviews with professionals to put together a case study.

There are two main deliverables -- the hardware and the software. The hardware consists of the data glove itself and other supporting components (such as a simple LCD screen for displaying entered data or a robot to be controlled by the glove). The main focus of the project is to use the data glove to recognize “finger-written” text (text written “in the air” by finger movement). Thus, machine learning will be involved so that the glove knows how to classify certain movements as certain characters. The glove will likely go through user-testing and I will analyze how well it performs (let me know if you want to user test it!). As a stretch goal, I will include multiple modes for the glove so that it can not only recognize finger-written text but that it can also control a second component such as a robotic arm.

Main Idea: Creating an application and/or business plan that creates a mentorship platform connecting university students with high-school students, and ensures that high-schoolers receive guidance for getting into universities abroad.
Purpose: Every year, 700000 Bangladeshi high school students drop out after high-school and are unable to attend universities. Not because of their lack of talent, but because Bangladesh doesn’t have enough university seats for such a large population. On the other hand, nearly 80,000 students from Bangladesh go to universities abroad every year. I myself have sought help from seniors in learning about the admission process and how to secure scholarships simply by being well informed.

Through CrossRoads, we want to connect the university students with high school students, so that the first group can help mentor the latter group with information like Common Application, SAT examination preparation, IELTS etc.
Intended Deliverable: In this project, I wish to create an application that connects students with mentors, and secondly, I wish to create a business plan (pitch deck) that helps the product grow after my graduation.
Guiding Question: “How can we create an web-app and deploy an organized business plan that allows us to help 1000 high-school students get into universities abroad?”

Specific question: How might we create a system that helps users who voluntarily want to solve their SNS-additions to change their habit of using SNS and reduce the frequency of relapse of the original usage pattern later? 

Specific idea: Many people already realize their strong SNS-addiction could be a problem. They want to reduce their usage and solve their addiction but cannot control themselves as they expected. Existing solutions are not sufficient to help people to solve SNS addiction. Through employing behavioral science and human-centered product development, the project will demonstrate that appropriate behavioral mechanisms embedded in technical products can help users who wish to solve their SNS addictions reduce their addictive behavior towards social networks by changing their usage patterns and desire to browse. 

The target audience of the problem would be users who wish to change their habits. Thus, the project will explore systematic means to help the audience change their habit by employing behavioral design techniques such as nudging, priming, reward learning, choice architecture, and gamification. Additionally, since humans are the center of the solution, I would adopt IDEO's human-centered design thinking approach to ensure the solution would genuinely serve the users.

Methods: design thinking, behavioral science, human-centered design (interview/survey: need interview, ideation interview, live prototyping, etc.), habit breaking, software development

One issue in developing the theory of ETIs is that different researchers are using widely varied definitions of biological individuals. My project will review these definitions and analyze the implications each has for ETI theory. In a philosophical paper, I will explore the connections between the definitions in the context of ETIs and attempt and argue what definition makes ETI theory most useful for scientific discovery.

For example, a conceptualization of soil as a living being may allow the principle of reciprocity to apply to the human-soil relationship, increasing motivation for soil stewardship. A body of relevant research on this topic already exists, under the name ethnopedology. Based on initial research, I believe the steps of this capstone would be:
Step 1 - A literature review of ethnopedology frameworks.
Step 2 - Select a framework that analyzes local beliefs and implies how these translate into conservation practices. In the language of ethnopedology, this framework would identify linkages between Kosmos and Corpus. 
Step 3 - Select about 3 societies that successfully managed their soil to use as case studies.
Step 4 - Apply the selected framework to these 3 societies and to agriculture in the modern United States.
Step 5 - The final deliverables are (1) An academic paper with the comparative analysis and (2) An art piece",the alternative project relies of in depth knowledge of other cultures which would require interviews and interactions with people from those cultures,N/A (no project ideas involve interacting with any people and/or their data),"-Iterative philosophical analysis and philosophical writing

",Kamler T@19,China GMT + 8,"General topic: Mental health at Minerva, educational material creation and evaluation
Specific idea: Minerva’s global rotation mode, online study design and the high expectations for its students means Minerva students need to face more instability and stress during four years in college, thus making them more vulnerable to mental health issues. This capstone aims to highlight the limitations of current CAPS programs which mostly target highly-motivated students who care a lot about their own mental health state but excluding those with low-motivation in mental health care. This capstone project is interested in exploring whether periodically sending students with tips about self-care and mental health knowledge will decrease their stress level, increase their awareness, knowledge and self-care skills in mental health.

Question: How does Minerva's mode of operation might affect students' mental health state? Will periodically sending students with tips about self-care and mental health knowledge decrease their stress level, increase their awareness, knowledge and self-care skills in mental health?

Method/approach: 
To answer the first question, perform analysis using literature review and information interview; To answer the second question: (1) Quantitative study (2) Survey students’ mental health knowledge and attitude before and after receiving the infographics (3) Use R or Stata to perform statistical analysis

Intended deliverables: A report containing the below elements
1. Analysis of factors contributing to Minervan’s mental health vulnerability
2. A series of mental health infographics aiming to improve students’
awareness and self-care ability of mental health
3. Quantitative analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of mental health

Specific idea:
Using machine learning algorithms to identify indicators that are good predictors of a country's economic outcomes (beyond GDP)

Method/approach:
Countries would becomes units of observations, with the different economic variables being the variables in the dataset (Times series/one specific year depending on the difficulty of the implementation).
I would use an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to look for patterns in the data. More specifically, first I would use a dimensionality reduction algorithm to delete some variables from a large dataset with lots of economic variables, then build an association rule learning algorithm on the variables left in the dataset and see if it outputs any interesting findings (e.g. Find several good predictors of an economic outcome that is unforeseen) or simply confirms economic theories.

A supervised learning algorithm will then be built for economic forecasting, and it will be built upon the findings in the unsupervised learning algorithm.
